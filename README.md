# HTML Magazine Cover

## Overview

In this lab you will recreate the Mass Appeal magazine article based on a mockup image and with provided source text and turn it into a webpage. No need to worry about styling the content as that has already been done for you. Just focus on writing in the proper HTML elements.

## Directions

1. Open the two mockup images (mockup-01-cover.png, mockup-02-article.png) as a reference on what our finished web page should look like.
2. Next open index.html in the browser (it will be mostly blank at this point).
3. Then, open index.html and use the comments written in the code to write the HTML elements you are asked to placing the elemnt just below each comment. Copy and paste the place filler text from the source.txt file as needed. You can save your progress and refresh the index page in the browser to check your progress.
4. When you are done make sure to validate your HTML code at:

If you need to look up how to write any HTML elements you can google search for them using the description in the comments or use the HTML element reference at the link:
